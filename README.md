# MyWebsite
This repository holds the source files for my personal website.

The website is written in [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using the [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
It is built with [Hugo-Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) and dynamically deployed from this repository with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
