Neurizons is a multidisciplinary neuroscience conference organized by the students of the [International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Neuroscience](https://www.gpneuro.uni-goettingen.de/), in Göttingen.

Modern neuroscience encompasses countless research approaches; from fundamental molecular investigations, to large-scale explorations of networks and cognition, all converge to tackle issues of the mind. At Neurizons, we invite researchers to discuss the latest research in neuroscience from a multitude of disciplines.

In addition to hosting renowned researchers, Neurizons promises a stage for young scientists to bring their own ideas forward, as well as a platform for learning and exchanging with masters in the field.

Neurizons provides the perfect milieu for stimulating discussions, whether it be during talks and poster sessions, or in the more informal settings of various social events. Neurizons also offers a great learning opportunity for students; we offer workshops for soft skills, mentoring sessions for academic career advice, and a chance to explore and assess career paths both within and outside of academia with the help of our career fair.

Join us at the 9th biennial conference – Neurizons – ‘Networks grow. Ideas flow.’ which will take place on the 26th – 29th May 2020 at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical chemistry in Göttingen, Germany.
