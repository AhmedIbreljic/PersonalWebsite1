I'm Nikoloz (Niko) Sirmpilatze, a medical doctor turned neuroscientist. Currently, I work as postdoctoral researcher at the [Functional Imaging Lab](https://www.dpz.eu/en/unit/functional-imaging-laboratory/about-us.html) of the German Primate Center in Göttingen, Germany. I study the effects of anesthesia on brain function using neuroimaging techniques, including functional Magnetic Imaging (fMRI) and in vivo 2‐photon calcium imaging. I am particularly interested in the neural activity patterns that arise across various depths of anesthesia, either spontaneously or in reaction to sensory stimulation. In parallel to my research, I support efforts for more open, collaborative, and reproducible science. In my free time I enjoy dancing to swing music and playing the saxophone.
