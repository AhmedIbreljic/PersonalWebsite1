## Summary
Deeply anesthetized and comatose states are often accompanied by a distinctive pattern of electroencephalographic activity called **burst-suppression**. This patternâ€™s underlying mechanism and
functional significance remain largely unknown. I explore how burst-suppression manifests itself in fMRI data obtained from from both humans and animals (non-human primates, rats).
